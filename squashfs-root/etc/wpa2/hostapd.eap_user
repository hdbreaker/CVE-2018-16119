# hostapd user database for integrated EAP authenticator

# Each line must contain an identity, EAP method(s), and an optional password
# separated with whitespace (space or tab). The identity and password must be
# double quoted ("user"). Password can alternatively be stored as
# NtPasswordHash (16-byte MD4 hash of the unicode presentation of the password
# in unicode) if it is used for MSCHAP or MSCHAPv2 authentication. This means
# that the plaintext password does not need to be included in the user file.
# Password hash is stored as hash:<16-octets of hex data> without quotation
# marks.

# [2] flag in the end of the line can be used to mark users for tunneled phase
# 2 authentication (e.g., within EAP-PEAP). In these cases, an anonymous
# identity can be used in the unencrypted phase 1 and the real user identity
# is transmitted only within the encrypted tunnel in phase 2. If non-anonymous
# access is needed, two user entries is needed, one for phase 1 and another
# with the same username for phase 2.
#
# EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP, EAP-TTLS, EAP-SIM, and EAP-AKA do not use password option.
# EAP-MD5, EAP-MSCHAPV2, EAP-GTC, EAP-PAX, EAP-PSK, and EAP-SAKE require a
# password.
# EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS require Phase 2 configuration.
#
# * can be used as a wildcard to match any user identity. The main purposes for
# this are to set anonymous phase 1 identity for EAP-PEAP and EAP-TTLS and to
# avoid having to configure every certificate for EAP-TLS authentication. The
# first matching entry is selected, so * should be used as the last phase 1
# user entry.
#
# "prefix"* can be used to match the given prefix and anything after this. The
# main purpose for this is to be able to avoid EAP method negotiation when the
# method is using known prefix in identities (e.g., EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA). This
# is only allowed for phase 1 identities.
#
# Multiple methods can be configured to make the authenticator try them one by
# one until the peer accepts one. The method names are separated with a
# comma (,).
#
# [ver=0] and [ver=1] flags after EAP type PEAP can be used to force PEAP
# version based on the Phase 1 identity. Without this flag, the EAP
# authenticator advertises the highest supported version and select the version
# based on the first PEAP packet from the supplicant.
