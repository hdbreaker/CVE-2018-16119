<LI>Click the <B>Enable/Disable</B> radio box to enable/disable internet access to ftp from WAN port. 
<LI>Change the <B>Service port</B> to specify a port for ftp server to use (default 21). 
<LI>The <B>Internet Address</B> displays the WAN IP address of this router, so that others can access ftp through this address.
<LI>If Wan type is PPPOE/PPTP/L2TP, there would be two connections. Therefore, users can access ftp server via two connections. Users in a private LAN can access ftp server via <B>Public Address</B> while internet users can access ftp server via <B>Internet Address</B>.
<LI>Click the <B>Start</B> button to start the ftp server.
