	 <p><B>Connect on Demand</B> - You can configure the Router to disconnect your Internet connection after a specified period of the Internet connectivity (<B>Max Idle Time</B>).

Otherwise, enter the number of minutes you want to have elapsed before your Internet connection terminates.</p>

Otherwise, enter the number in minutes that you wish to have the Internet connecting last unless a new link requested.</p>
