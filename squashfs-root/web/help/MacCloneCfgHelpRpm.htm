<H1>MAC Clone Help</H1>
<p>Most Cable ISPs (Internet Service Provider) register the unique MAC Address from the wired connection on your <span id = "t_main_computer" style="color:#FF0000">MAIN COMPUTER - the last computer used to be connected with the Cable Modem and had Internet connection</span>.</p>
<p>If you add a router to the network, your ISP may not recognize the MAC address of the router and not allow it to connect.</p>
<p>However, TP-LINK router can "clone" or replicate the registered MAC address of the MAIN COMPUTER. Then your ISP can release the Internet connection to the router and all the computers.</p>
<P><B>WAN MAC Address</B> -  This field displays the current MAC address of the WAN port. If your ISP requires that you register the MAC address, please enter the correct MAC address into this field. The format for the MAC Address is XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX (X is any hexadecimal digit). </P>
<P><B>Your PC's MAC Address</B> - This field displays the MAC address of the PC that is managing the Router. If the MAC address of your adapter is registered, you can click the <B>Clone MAC Address</B> button , then it will be filled into the <B>WAN MAC Address</B> field.</P>
<P>Click <B>Restore Factory MAC</B> to restore the MAC address of WAN port to the factory default value.</P>
<P>Click the <B>Save</B> button to save your settings.</P>
<p><B>Note</B>: 
<ol type=1>
<li>Please ensure you are doing the MAC Clone with the wired connection of your <span style="color:#FF0000">MAIN COMPUTER</span> which used to be connected with your Cable Modem and had Internet connection.</li>
<li>Only the PC(s) in your LAN can use the <B>MAC Address Clone</B> feature.</li>
<li>If you change <B>WAN MAC Address</B> when the WAN connection type is PPPoE, it will not take effect until the connection is re-established.</li>
