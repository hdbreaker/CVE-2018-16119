<H1>Virtual Servers Help</H1>
<P>Virtual servers can be used for setting up public services on your LAN. A virtual server is defined as a service port, and all requests from Internet to this service port will be redirected to the computer specified by the server IP. Any PC that was used for a virtual server must have a static or reserved IP address because its IP address may change when using the DHCP function.</P>

<ul>
<lI><B>Service Port</B> - The numbers of External Service Ports. You can enter a service port or a range of service ports (the format is XXX - YYY, XXX is Start port, YYY is End port). </lI>
<lI><B>Internal Port</B> - The Internal Service Port number of the PC running the service application. You can leave it blank if the <B>Internal Port</B> is the same as the <B>Service Port</B>, or enter a specific port number when <B>Service Port</B> is a single one. </lI>
<lI><B>IP Address</B> - The IP address of the PC running the service application.</lI>
<lI><B>Protocol</B> - The protocol used for this application, either <B>TCP, </B><B>UDP</B>, or <B>All </B>(all protocols supported by the Router).</lI>

<lI><B>Status</B> - The status of this entry, "Enabled" means the virtual server entry is enabled.</lI>
<lI><B>Common Service Port</B> - Some common services already exist in the pull-down list.</lI>
