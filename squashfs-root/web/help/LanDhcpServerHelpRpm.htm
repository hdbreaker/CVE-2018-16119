<lI><B>End IP Address</B> - This field specifies the last address in the IP Address pool. 192.168.0.199 is the default end IP address.</lI>

<lI><B>Address Lease Time</B> - The <B>Address Lease Time</B> is the length of time a network user will be allowed to keep connecting to the Router with the current DHCP Address.
