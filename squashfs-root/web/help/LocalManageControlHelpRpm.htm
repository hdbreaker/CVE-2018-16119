<p>This page allows you to deny LAN computers from accessing the Router.</p>

<p>
By default, the radio button 
<B>All the PCs on the LAN are allowed to access the Router's Web-Based Utility</B> is selected. 
If you want to allow PCs with specific MAC Addresses to access the Setup page of the Router's Web-Based Utility locally, from inside the network, 
click the radio button <B>Only the PCs listed can browse the built-in web pages to perform Administrator tasks</B>,
and then enter each MAC Address in a separate field. The format for the MAC Address is 
XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX (X is any hexadecimal digit).
Only the PCs with the MAC address listed can use the password to browse the built-in web pages to perform Administrator tasks and all the others will be blocked.
<P>After click the <B>Add</B> button, your PC's MAC Address will be placed in the Control List above.</P>
